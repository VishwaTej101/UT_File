### Evaluation Methods

Accessibility evaluation was conducted based on identified defects and testing.

### Conclusion

New Reporting Portal is generally in conformance with accessibility standards. However, some issues were identified with respect to the "Resize Text" criterion (1.4.4) related to zooming and focus management (2.4.7), as well as the reading of account name instructions (3.3.2). Remediation efforts are recommended to address these issues and enhance accessibility further.
