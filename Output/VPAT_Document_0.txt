Recommendations: 
Based on the assessment, the following recommendations are provided to improve the accessibility of the project:
- Implement alt text for all images to ensure screen reader accessibility.
- Include appropriate headers for data tables to provide context for screen reader users.
- Add ARIA roles to key interactive elements to ensure accurate interpretation by screen readers.
- Ensure visible focus indicators for interactive elements to enhance keyboard navigation.
- Make the website responsive for improved accessibility on mobile devices.
- Include a "skip to content" link at the beginning of the page to facilitate navigation for keyboard and screen reader users.
- Provide captions or transcripts for videos to make them accessible to individuals with hearing impairments.
- Use descriptive link text to provide clarity on the destination of the links.
- Include form labels for all form fields to assist screen reader users in understanding their purpose.
- Improve keyboard navigation by ensuring that all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard input.
- Enhance color contrast in the navigation menu for better readability by users with vision impairments.

Conclusion: 
The "Accessibility Testing Defects" project has made significant progress towards meeting WCAG 2.1 accessibility guidelines. However, there are several areas that require improvement, particularly related to data tables, keyboard navigation, color contrast, link descriptions, form labels, and ARIA roles. Addressing these issues will enhance the overall accessibility of the project.
