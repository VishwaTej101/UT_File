{"\ufeffVoluntary Product Accessibility Template\u00ae (VPAT\u00ae)\nVersion 2.0\nVoluntary Product Accessibility Template\u00ae (VPAT\u00ae)\t1\nAbout This Document\t1\nEssential Requirements and Best Practices for Information & Communications Technology (ICT) Vendors\t2\n[Company] Accessibility Conformance Report\t10\n\n\n\n\nAbout This Document\nThis document is broken into two main sections:\n    \u2022 Essential Requirements and Best Practices for using the VPAT\u00ae to complete an Accessibility Conformance Report\n    \u2022 The VPAT Template\n\nPlease carefully review the Essential Requirements and Best Practices sections before using the VPAT to create an Accessibility Conformance Report. The VPAT 2.0 template now includes criteria from WCAG 2.0 and EN 301 549, as well as the Revised Section 508 Standards and Section 255 guidelines.\n\n\u201cVoluntary Product Accessibility Template\u201d and \u201cVPAT,\u201d including the template format, are Federally Registered Service Marks of the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI). VPAT 2.0 users agree not to deviate materially from the template format provided by ITI, and to use the service mark (\u201c\u00ae\u201d) where appropriate.\nEssential Requirements and Best Practices for Information & Communications Technology (ICT) Vendors\n\nThis section provides guidance for reporting product conformance for three major accessibility standards and guidelines using the VPAT\u00ae to produce the Accessibility Conformance Report. Deviating from these guidelines precludes vendors from referencing the template by name and/or the VPAT acronym. The purpose of these essential requirements and best practices are to promote accurate and consistent reporting of product accessibility information.\n\nThe VPAT is a template used to document a product's conformance with accessibility standards and guidelines. The purpose of the VPAT is to assist customers and buyers in making preliminary assessments regarding the availability of commercial \"Electronic and Information Technology,\" also referred to as \u201cInformation and Communication Technology\u201d (ICT) products and services with features that support accessibility.\n\nGetting Started\n    1. Before creating a report, read all of the materials provided in this document.\n    2. The Information Technology Industry Council (ITI) provides the VPAT. Use of the template and service mark does not require membership in ITI.\n    3. Determine which accessibility standards/guidelines will be included in the product conformance report\n    4. It is the vendor\u2019s responsibility to maintain the integrity of the data in the report.\n\nEssential Requirements for Authors\nThe following are the minimum requirements to be a VPAT\u00ae.\n\n    1. The VPAT name and template are registered service marks of ITI. Use of the VPAT template and name requires the inclusion of the registered service mark (i.e., \u201cVPAT\u00ae\u201d). Users of the VPAT agree not to deviate from the Essential Requirements for Authors.\n    2. The template file can be used as is or replicated in a different delivery format, for example as HTML or PDF. The only requirement is that the final conformance report must be accessible.\n    3. A report may contain a minimum of one applicable Standard/Guideline or any combination of the three Standards/Guidelines that are applicable to the product being reported.\n    4. A report must contain the following content at a minimum:\n        \u25e6 Report Title \u2013 In the heading format of \u201c[Company Name] Accessibility Conformance Report\u201d\n        \u25e6 VPAT Heading Information \u2013 Template version\n        \u25e6 Name of Product/Version \u2013 Name of Product being reported, including version of the product\n        \u25e6 Product Description \u2013 A brief description of the product\n        \u25e6 Date \u2013 Date of report publication. At a minimum, provide the month and year of the report publication. For example, \u201cMay 2016\u201d. If date is included ensure it is clear \u201c4 May 2016\u201d or \u201cMay 4, 2016\u201d.\n        \u25e6 Contact Information \u2013 Contact Information for follow-up questions. Listing an email is sufficient.\n        \u25e6 Notes \u2013 Any details or further explanation about the product or the report. This section may be left blank.\n        \u25e6 Evaluation Methods Used \u2013 Include a description of what evaluation methods were used to complete the VPAT for the product under test.\n        \u25e6 Applicable Standards/Guidelines \u2013 A clear indication of which Standards/Guidelines this Conformance Report covers.\n            \u25aa The list must include only the Standards/Guidelines that were used to develop the product.\n            \u25aa A report must contain a minimum of one Standard/Guideline or any combination of the three Standards.\n            \u25aa The applicable Standards/Guidelines that may be included are:\n                \u2022 Revised Section 508, as published in 2017, at www.Section508.gov\n                \u2022 Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 or WCAG 2.0 (ISO/IEC 40500), at http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20- 20081211/\n                \u2022 EN 301 549 \u201cAccessibility requirements suitable for public procurement of ICT products and services in Europe\u201d, at http://mandate376.standards.eu/standard\n            \u25aa This information can be in a table format at the top of the report with the table heading \u2018Standards/Guidelines\u2019 and the reported Standards/Guidelines identified.\n            \u25aa Alternatively, the Standard/Guideline being reported can be clearly identified in the introductory text of the report. If multiple Standards or Guideline tables are included, each table should also be clearly identified as to the Standard or Guideline the criteria that table represents.\n        \u25e6 Terms \u2013 Conformance level terms description section\n        \u25e6 Tables for Each Standard or Guideline \u2013 Tables showing the responses to the criteria.\n    5. WCAG Conformance Tables \u2013 The answers in the WCAG success criteria tables are based on the level of conformance being reported (Level A, AA or AAA).\n    \u2022 These tables are used to answer:\n        \u25e6 2017 Section 508:\n            \u25aa Chapter 5 Software\n            \u25aa Chapter 6 Support Documentation\n        \u25e6 EN 301 549 Standard:\n            \u25aa Chapter 9 Web\n            \u25aa Chapter 10 Non-Web\n            \u25aa Chapter 11 Software\n            \u25aa Chapter 12 Documentation and Support Services\n        \u25e6 The selected levels of WCAG 2.0 Guidelines.\n    \u2022 Due to answers applying to multiple criteria, when answering for the 2017 Section 508 or EN 301 549, the answers need to be clear in what individual criteria the answer applies to. It is possible to either use a summary, selecting the worst case for the criteria, or to have separate answers or even tables for software, support documentation, authoring tools, etc., so long as the methodology used is made clear.\n    \u2022 If not completing a set of Standards such as Section 508 or EN 301 549, then remove the breakdown information and answer only for the WCAG criteria.\n    6. Conformance Levels \u2013 The report must list the definition of the terms used in the Conformance Level column. ITI recommends the following terms. If a vendor deviates from the ITI definitions, the vendor shall reference this change in the heading Notes section. If a term is not used it can be removed from the list. The ITI definitions are:\n        \u25e6 Supports: The functionality of the product has at least one method that meets the criterion without known defects or meets with equivalent facilitation.\n        \u25e6 Supports with Exceptions: Some functionality of the product does not meet the criterion.\n        \u25e6 Does Not Support: The majority of product functionality does not meet the criterion.\n        \u25e6 Not Applicable: The criterion is not relevant to the product.\n        \u25e6 Not Evaluated: The product has not been evaluated against the criterion. This can only be used in WCAG 2.0 Level AAA.\n\nNote: When filling in the WCAG tables, a response may use 'Supports' where one might otherwise be inclined to use 'Not Applicable'. This is in keeping with WCAG 2.0 Understanding Conformance: 'This means that if there is no content to which a success criterion applies, the success criterion is satisfied.\n    7. Remarks and Explanations \u2013 Detailed remarks should be provided in the Remarks and Explanations column to justify your answer in the Conformance Level column.\n        \u25e6 When the conformance level is \u2018supports with exceptions\u2019 or \u2018does not support\u2019, the remarks should identify:\n    1. The functions or features with issues\n    2. How they do not fully support\n        \u25e6 If the criterion does not apply, explain why.\n        \u25e6 If an accessible alternative is used, describe it.\n        \u25e6 In the Section 508 tables, when subsections of criteria do not apply to the product, the section may be summarized or removed as long as an explanation is provided explaining why a criterion does not apply. Another alternative is to leave the table and add a summary why the section doesn\u2019t apply. For example, in Chapter 5 the criteria in 502 and 503 will not apply to a web only application, thus those sections can be removed with a summary in the notes for the chapter, or a row in the table.\n\nBest Practices for Authors\nITI suggests that authors adopt the following best practices when using the VPAT\u00ae to create an Accessibility Conformance Report.\n\n    \u2022 Branding Header: Company logo or branding information\n    \u2022 Date Changes: If a report is revised, change the report date and explain the revision in the Notes section. Alternately, create a new report and explain in the Notes section that it supersedes an earlier version of the report.\n    \u2022 Notes: Add any notes applicable to product or the report\n        \u25e6 Additional information about the product version that the document references\n        \u25e6 Any revisions to the document\n        \u25e6 Links to any related documents\n        \u25e6 Additional information describing the product\n        \u25e6 Additional information about what the document does or does not cover\n        \u25e6 Information suggested by the WCAG 2.0 Conformance Claim, at http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#conformance-claims\n        \u25e6 Information needed to satisfy ISO/IEC 17050-1:2004, Supplier\u2019s\nDeclaration of Conformity\n    \u2022 Evaluation Methods Used \u2013 Information to enter may include the following:\n        \u25e6 Testing is based on general product knowledge\n        \u25e6 Similar to another evaluated product\n        \u25e6 Testing with assistive technologies\n        \u25e6 Published test method (provide name, publisher, URL link)\n        \u25e6 Vendor proprietary test method\n        \u25e6 Other test method\n    \u2022 Remarks and Explanations: This section may include:\n        \u25e6 Information regarding the testing of a given criteria.\n        \u25e6 Information on application dependencies to support accessibility (e.g. OS, app frameworks, browsers recommended).\n        \u25e6 How the customer can find more information about accessibility issues. One method can be to include the bug ID where customers can call the company\u2019s customer support to get additional information.\n        \u25e6 Known workarounds for accessibility issues.\n    \u2022 Legal Disclaimer: Area for any legal disclaimer text required by your organization.\n    \u2022 Saving Space: To reduce the size of the report it is acceptable to remove sections. Individual criteria cannot be removed, only sections at a time. Section removal is acceptable in four situations:\n        \u25e6 When an entire standard is not being reported on, for example EN 301 549, there should be no references of it in the report.\n        \u25e6 When an entire section is not being reported on because it doesn\u2019t\napply to the product, for example:\n            \u25aa Chapter 4: Hardware. Information should be included in the notes for that section why it has been removed.\n            \u25aa A card reader that doesn\u2019t have sound could remove the criteria in section 413 Closed Caption Processing Technologies and just note the why the criteria doesn\u2019t apply.\n        \u25e6 If the product is not being evaluated for a level of the criteria (for example Level AAA) then that table may be deleted.\n        \u25e6 If a requesting customer has identified that a section of the standard does not apply, information should be included in the notes that the section has been removed.\n    \u2022 WCAG 2.0 Tables: The WCAG 2.0 criteria is shown in three tables, Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA.\n        \u25e6 If desired, these tables can be combined into one table.\n        \u25e6 When reporting on a level (A, AA or AAA) all criteria for that level must be answered.\n    \u2022 Language: Use text appropriate for your audience.\n    \u2022 Multiple Reports: When using the VPAT to create an Accessibility Conformance Report for complex products it may be helpful to separate answers into multiple reports. For example, when a product is an Authoring Tool that also has web content and documentation. When multiple reports are used for a complex product, it is required to explain this and how to reach the other reports in the Notes section of each report.\n    \u2022 Criteria Text: To help conserve space in the ITI template only the criteria ID number and a short title have been included. Where possible, links have been included to the standard/guideline.\n        \u25e6 It is acceptable to add the full text of the criteria into the cell if desired to help with understanding.\n        \u25e6 The links to the standards/guidelines can be removed.\n    \u2022 Ordering of Tables: The order that the standards/guideline tables appear may be changed to facilitate reading. For example, if the Accessibility Conformance Report is for Section 508 only, the WCAG tables may be moved to follow the numbering scheme used in the Section 508 criteria.\n    \u2022 Guideline Section Heading Rows in Tables: The tables include heading rows to facilitate understanding the context of the criteria.\n        \u25e6 The cells in these rows do not require answers as indicated by \u201cHeading\ncell \u2013 no response required.\u201d\n        \u25e6 It is optional to add a response if desired.\n        \u25e6 The shading of the row is also optional.\n        \u25e6 If removing the heading rows, edit the criteria titles so it\u2019s clear where they\napply.\n\nPosting the Final Document\n    \u2022 Remove the Essential Requirements and Best Practices for Information & Communications Technology (ICT) Vendors section from the template when publishing your Accessibility Conformance Report in final form. A link on page one in the template footnotes contains a hyperlink to this document on the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI) website at: http://www.itic.org.\n    \u2022 Check for each required item in the VPAT\u00ae document:\n        \u25e6 The report title [Company Name] Accessibility Conformance Report\n        \u25e6 The \u201cVPAT\u00ae Version 2.0\u201d heading\n        \u25e6 Name of Product/Version\n        \u25e6 Product Description\n        \u25e6 Date\n        \u25e6 Contact Information\n        \u25e6 Notes\n        \u25e6 Evaluation methods used\n        \u25e6 Applicable Standards/Guidelines\n        \u25e6 Terms\n        \u25e6 Report Information\n            \u25aa Check that there is a response for each criterion for \u2018Conformance Level\u2019 and \u2018Remarks and Explanations.\u2019\n    \u2022 Post your final document on your company\u2019s web site, or make the document available to customers upon request.\n    \u2022 Your final document should be accessible.\n\nTable Information for VPAT\u00ae Readers\nFor each of the standards, the criteria are listed by chapter in a table. The structures of the tables are: the first column contains the criteria being evaluated, the second column describes the level of conformance of the product regarding the criteria and the third column contains any additional remarks and explanations regarding the product.\n\n    \u2022 When sections of criteria do not apply, or deemed by the customer as not applicable, the section is noted as such and the rest of that table may be removed for that section.\n    \u2022 When multiple standards are being recorded in this document, the duplicative sections are noted and responded to only one time. The duplicate entry will note the cross reference to the data.\n[Company] Accessibility Conformance Report\nVPAT\u00ae Version 2.0 \u2013 October 2017\n\nName of Product/Version:\nProduct Description:\nDate: 23rd July, 2018\nContact information:\nNotes:\nEvaluation Methods Used: WCAG 2.0 - AA Standards\nApplicable Standards/Guidelines\nThis report covers the degree of conformance for the following accessibility standard/guidelines:\n\nStandard/Guideline\nIncluded In Report\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, at http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC- WCAG20-20081211/\nLevel A (Yes) Level AA (Yes)\nLevel AAA (No)\nSection 508 as published in 2017, at http://www.Section508.gov\n(No)\nEN 301 549 Accessibility requirements suitable for public procurement of ICT\nproducts and services in Europe, at http://mandate376.standards.eu/standard\n(No)\n\n\n\n\u201cVoluntary Product Accessibility Template\u201d and \u201cVPAT\u201d are registered\nservice marks of the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI)\tPage 10 of 31\nTerms\nThe terms used in the Conformance Level information are defined as follows:\n\n    \u2022 Supports: The functionality of the product has at least one method that meets the criterion without known defects or meets with equivalent facilitation.\n    \u2022 Supports with Exceptions: Some functionality of the product does not meet the criterion.\n    \u2022 Does Not Support: The majority of product functionality does not meet the criterion.\n    \u2022 Not Applicable: The criterion is not relevant to the product.\n    \u2022 Not Evaluated: The product has not been evaluated against the criterion.
